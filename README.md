# JS---Aliens-Game-OOP

A coursework project to showcase what we have learnt on the course so far. This includes more advanced Javascript techniques and
adopting an OOP mindest to the challenge, to be written in 150 lines of code and simple.

The project is a game based loosely around space invaders. I decided to style it around battleships, with dynamically generated HTML via JS, utilising a CSS GRID as a template
for the placement of the ships that acts as 'co-ordinates' for random targeting(shooting of ship).

A CLASS for the actual game was used with methods for boardgame generation, winner checking and game update status.

A CLASS for the ships was used then initialised the different ships(objects) with parameters for name, colour, points and position(s) to place on board

Able to restart the game without having to refresh the page
Utilised a JS switch case and the DOM to handle the points scoring based on ship Id.

Added a flash animation library to indicate which ship was hit.
