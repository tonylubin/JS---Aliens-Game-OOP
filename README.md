# JS---Aliens-Game-OOP

A coursework project to showcase what we have learnt on the course so far. This includes more advanced Javascript techniques and
adopting an OOP mindest to the challenge, with the challenge of writing it in less than 180 lines of code with a minimalist design.

The project is a game based loosely around space invaders, which I decided to style it around battleships.

- Dynamically generated HTML via JS, utilising CSS GRID as a template for the placement of the ships that act as 'co-ordinates' for random targeting(shooting of ship).

- A CLASS for the actual game was used with methods for board game generation, winner checking and game update status.

- A CLASS for the ships was used then initialised for the different ships(objects) with parameters for name, colour, points and position(s) to place on board

- Able to restart the game without having to refresh the page.
- Utilised a JS switch case and the DOM to handle the points scoring based on ship Id.

- Added a flash animation library to indicate which ship was hit with icons as a background image for styling.
